We can use dynamic programming to compute the value of the best solution. 
We do not need to print what the actual sets are. 

Weighted Interval Scheduling Problem

Goal: Find maximum weight subset of mutally compatible jobs. 

1. Label jobs by finishing time.
Def: p(j) = largest index i < j such that job is compatible with j

Notation: OPT(j) = value of optimal solution to the problem consisting
of job requests 1,2,...,j.
